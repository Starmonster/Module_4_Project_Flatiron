# Module_4_Project_Flatiron
Movie recommendation system - a project by James Moulds and Jahir Miah

Business Questions

A) Cold Start Problem - Get universally popular movies and recommend these as initial options to new customers.

B) Collaborative Filtering - Find similarities between users' explicit and implicit ratings and make recommendations to one user based on their mutually similar ratings with another user. User by user. 

c) Content-based Filtering - Find similarities between movies based on existing reviews. If we ask a user what their favourite movie or what rating they give a movie we can then offer recommendations based on similar movies. Item by Item.
